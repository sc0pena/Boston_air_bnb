## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Libraries used found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. This code works with Python version 3.

## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
Analyze, model, and visualize three questions related to Boston AirBNB listing data:
1. Is number of of bathrooms closely related to listing price? what about number of bedrooms?
2. Can we provide insight into how much a rental with a certain number of bedrooms/bathrooms should list?
3. Can we provide Airbnb owners typical rental prices in different Boston neighborhoods? 
4. Can we provide Boston Airbnb owners feedback on rental type demand (IE, are rooms or full units in higher demand)?

## Background<a name="background"></a> 
This is an assignment for the Udacity Data Scientist nano degree program. 
Listing data collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). Data is from 2009-2016. 

## File Descriptions<a name="descriptions"></a> 
- SP_dsnano_BostonAirbnb.ipynb - notebook containing CRISP-DM process flow and other details 
- Boston_listings.csv - file downloaded from Kaggle containing Airbnb listing data

## Results<a name="results"></a> 
- A business explanation of the results can be found on Medium: LINK HERE
- For question 1 - number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms is correlated to pricing (number increases, price of listing increases). A higher correlation exists between pricing and bedrooms then it does for pricing and bathrooms
- CRISP-DM process flow, coding, and technical notation found within the Jupyter notebook
