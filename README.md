# Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
Analyze, model, and visualize three questions related to Boston AirBNB listing data:
1. Is number of of bathrooms closely related to listing price? what about number of bedrooms?
2. Can we provide insight into how much a rental with a certain number of bedrooms/bathrooms should list?
3. Can we provide Airbnb owners typical rental prices in different Boston neighborhoods? 
4. Can we provide Boston Airbnb owners feedback on rental type demand (IE, are rooms or full units in higher demand)?

Background: 
Listing data collected from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). Data is from 2009-2016. 

CRISP-DM process provided in the Jupyter notebook (SP_dsnano_BostonAirbnb.ipynb)

For question 1 (pricing increase based on rooms, beds, bathrooms) correlation plotted on scatter diagram + statistics provided

For question 2 (neighborhood pricing) displayed results on a bar chart and show descriptive statistics

For question 3 (rental type demand based on 90 day availability) show inferential and descriptive statistics
